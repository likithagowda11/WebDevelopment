  <h3>Server Side Coding</h3>
  <p id="cc">Most large-scale websites use server-side code to dynamically display different data when needed, generally
    pulled out of a database stored on a server and sent to the client to be displayed via some code (e.g. HTML and
    JavaScript).</p>
  <br>
  <div class="im">
    <a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NPp9C3hNIHDBbH-shEarOw@2x.png"><img id="li" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NPp9C3hNIHDBbH-shEarOw@2x.png"></a>

  </div>

  <p id="cc">Perhaps the most significant benefit of server-side code is that it allows you to tailor website content
    for individual users. Dynamic sites can highlight content that is more relevant based on user preferences and
    habits. It can also make sites easier to use by storing personal preferences and information — for example reusing
    stored credit card details to streamline subsequent payments.

    It can even allow interaction with users of the site, sending notifications and updates via email or through other
    channels. All of these capabilities enable much deeper engagement with users.

    In the modern world of web development, learning about server-side development is highly recommended.</h4>
    <br>
  <p id="cc">Web browsers communicate with web servers using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). When you click a
    link on a web page, submit a form, or run a search, an HTTP request is sent from your browser to the target server.

    The request includes a URL identifying the affected resource, a method that defines the required action (for example
    to get, delete, or post the resource), and may include additional information encoded in URL parameters (the
    field-value pairs sent via a query string), as POST data (data sent by the HTTP POST method), or in associated
    cookies.</p>
  <p id="cc">Web servers wait for client request messages, process them when they arrive, and reply to the web browser
    with an HTTP response message. The response contains a status line indicating whether or not the request succeeded
    (e.g. "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" for success).

    The body of a successful response to a request would contain the requested resource (e.g. a new HTML page, or an
    image), which could then be displayed by the web browser.</p>

    <h4>Static Sites</h4>
  </a>
  <br>
  <p id="cc">The diagram below shows a basic web server architecture for a static site (a static site is one that
    returns the same hard-coded content from the server whenever a particular resource is requested). When a user wants
    to navigate to a page, the browser sends an HTTP "GET" request specifying its URL.

    The server retrieves the requested document from its file system and returns an HTTP response containing the
    document and a success status (usually 200 OK). If the file cannot be retrieved for some reason, an error status is
    returned (see client error responses and server error responses).</p>

    <h4>Dynamic Sites</h4>
  </a>
  <br>
  <p id="cc">A dynamic website is one where some of the response content is generated dynamically, only when needed. On
    a dynamic website HTML pages are normally created by inserting data from a database into placeholders in HTML
    templates (this is a much more efficient way of storing large amounts of content than using static websites).

    A dynamic site can return different data for a URL based on information provided by the user or stored preferences
    and can perform other operations as part of returning a response (e.g. sending notifications).

    Most of the code to support a dynamic website must run on the server. Creating this code is known as "server-side
    programming" (or sometimes "back-end scripting").</p>
  <p id="cc"> diagram below shows a simple architecture for a dynamic website. As in the previous diagram, browsers send
    HTTP requests to the server, then the server processes the requests and returns appropriate HTTP responses.

    Requests for static resources are handled in the same way as for static sites (static resources are any files that
    don't change — typically: CSS, JavaScript, Images, pre-created PDF files, etc.).</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p id="cc">Requests for dynamic resources are instead forwarded (2) to server-side code (shown in the diagram as a Web
    Application). For "dynamic requests" the server interprets the request, reads required information from the database
    (3), combines the retrieved data with HTML templates (4), and sends back a response containing the generated HTML
    (5,6).</p>
