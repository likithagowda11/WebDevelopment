    <h4>Frontend Development:</h4>
    <pre
        id="cc">   Frontend development focus on the structure and the design of the website.A front-end developer uses code that affects how a website looks and how a user interacts with its webpages.
That includes simple elements such as buttons that take a visitor to different places within the website, as well as input methods, like a contact form.
The programming languages that a front-end developer uses can create a static webpage or a dynamic one. Programming languages they use include:</pre>
    <h6>Languages used for Frontend Development are:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li><a class="ht" aria-current="page" href="html1.html">HTML</a></li>
        <li><a class="ct" aria-current="page" href="css1.html">CSS</a></li>
        <li><a class="jt" aria-current="page" href="js1.html">JavaScript</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hypertext Markup Language</h3>
    <br>
    <pre id="cc">   HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web.
By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.        
HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.</pre>

                <p id="cc">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed
                    to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often
                    assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                    JavaScript.

                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                    into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                    included cues for its appearance.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
                    constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered
                    page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text
                    such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
                    tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img&gt; and &lt;input&gt; directly introduce
                    content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; surround and provide information
                    about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use
                    them to interpret the content of the page.

                    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the
                    behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The
                    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
                    standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of
                    HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt;
                    element, together with JavaScript.</p>

    <h3>Cascading style Sheets</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="container">

            <div class="col-md-6">

                <br>
                <p id="cc">Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to
                    simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages.
                    More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.
                    It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. In
                    short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how
                    it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.

                    While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides
                    powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.CSS is designed to enable the separation
                    of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content
                    accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
                    characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
                    separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
                    the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and
                    its formatting.

                    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                    different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                    speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
                    alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

                    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
                    more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

                    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
                    (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a
                    free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

                    In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG,
                    and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit</p>

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <br>
    <p id="cc"> JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of
        the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
        webpage behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
        engine to execute the code on users' devices.

        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.It has
        dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
        event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
        for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
        (DOM).

        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a
        variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
        are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
