  <h3>Backend Development</h3>
  <p id="cc">activities that are done at the back end of programs are referred to as back end development. Back-end
    development covers server-side web application logic and integration and activities, like writing APIs, creating
    libraries, and working with system components instead of frontend development, which focuses on customer-facing
    services and programs. Backend developers build code that allows a database and an application to communicate with
    one another. Backend developers take care and maintain the back-end of a website, Including databases, servers, and
    apps, and they control what you don't see.</p>

        <p id="cc">Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can’t see
          on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end
          logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers
          communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.

          On a team, back-end developers collaborate with front-end developers, product managers, principal architects,
          and website testers to build the structure of a website or mobile app. Back-end developers must be familiar
          with many kinds of tools and frameworks, including languages such as Python, Java, and Ruby. They make sure
          the back-end performs quickly and responsively to front-end user requests.</p>

        <a class="lli"href="https://distantjob.com/blog/backend-engineer-backend-developer/"><h4>Back-end developer vs. back-end engineer</h4></a>
        <p id="cc">Back-end developers and engineers have similar technical skills, but different responsibilities. A
          back-end developer is like a teacher, whereas a back-end engineer is like a school principal who creates the
          big-picture strategy. Back-end developers tend to focus on smaller parts of the whole, such as applications
          and programs, working with teams to prove their design methods are viable. </p>
