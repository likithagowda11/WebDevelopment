  <h3>Client Side Coding</h3>
  <p id="cc">Client-side tooling can be intimidating, but this series of articles aims to illustrate the purpose of some
    of the most common client-side tool types, explain the tools you can chain together, how to install them using
    package managers, and control them using the command line. We finish up by providing a complete toolchain example
    showing you how to get productive.</p>

  <p id="cc">The client is simply the browser a person is using to view a site, and it’s where client-side technology is
    unpacked and processed. The server is at a remote location anywhere in the world — housing data, running a site’s
    back-end architecture, processing requests, and sending pages to the browser. The client is anywhere our users are
    viewing our site: mobile devices, laptops, or desktop computers. Server-side scripting is executed by a web server;
    client-side scripting is executed by a browser.</p>
  <h4>Client-Side: Use Cases</h4>
  <br>
  <p id="cc">Netflix is a globally known brand, hence an excellent example of how a client-side model works. If a user
    types ‘netflix.com’ into their browser bar, they generate a request to the DNS servers for the netflix.com IP
    address.

    The DNS servers respond by serving the IP address to the browser.The user’s browser applies this IP to request
    Netflix’s servers to provide the content on the page – such as the Netflix logo, search bar, or movie thumbnail
    images</p>
  <p id="cc">
    Netflix then loads the content on the client’s device. The client-side browser interprets how the HTML, JavaScript,
    and CSS controlling the Netflix main page appears to the user.

    Moreover, the page can also respond to ‘events.’ for example, if the user’s mouse hovers over a movie thumbnail
    image, the image enlarges, and neighboring thumbnails move a little to the side to make room for the enlarged image.

    But, again, this is a client-side process – the code inside the actual webpage responds to the user’s mouse and
    commences this action without communicating with the server.

    Server-side refers to where processes run – in this case, on the server and not on t</p>
