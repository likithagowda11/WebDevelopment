  <h3>JavaScript</h3>
  <br>
  <p id="cc"> JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the
    World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
    behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
    execute the code on users' devices.

    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.It has
    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
    event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
    working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
    facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a
    variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are
    distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

        <p id="cc">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
          displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
          technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
          multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
          its appearance.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
          objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
          structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
          quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
          &lt;img&gt; and &lt;input&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; and
          &lt;/p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do
          not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

          HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
          content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
          Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged
          the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to
          display video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, together with JavaScript.</p>

        <p id="cc">The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993.
          Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide
          Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished
          browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.

          During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic
          behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene
          to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued
          two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while
          also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]

          Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax
          similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.Although the new language and its
          interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September
          1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.

          The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the
          time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a
          marketing ploy by Netscape.
