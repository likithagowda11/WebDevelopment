  <h3>Database-Technology</h3>
  <p id="cc">Databases store, organize, and process information in a way that makes it easy for us to go back and find
    what we’re looking for. We encounter data sets, both simple and complex, all the time, whether in the form of
    library card catalogs, financial records, and even contact directories. But what are databases in the context of a
    website?

    In this quick guide to modern database technology, you’ll get an understanding of how databases work, common terms
    to know, a look at SQL vs. NoSQL, and how to determine which database is best for your web application.</p>

  <p id="cc">Spreadsheets process numbers and databases process information—specifically, structured information.
    Databases can be designed to do just about anything with information, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li id="cc">Track, organize, and edit data</li>
    <li id="cc">Collect data and produce reports, or</li>
    <li id="cc">Be the foundation for information-rich, dynamic websites</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p id="cc">The most common database technology today is the relational database. Relational databases store data in a
    normalized way—that means the data is split up into different tables to avoid redundancy. While relational databases
    have been around for quite a while now, they offer a versatile tool for both data storage and data management. Both
    user-facing applications with high demands on performance and reporting software can be backed by a relational
    database.However, there are cases when relational databases might not be your first choice.</p>

  <p id="cc"> One case is when the rigid structure of the data in a relational database does not fit the data that you
    want to store. For example, you might want to store a JSON document without a specified schema. It could, for
    example, be a configuration file or some form of user-generated data. This is when NoSQL databases are useful. The
    data is usually queried using an API or SDK instead of SQL, hence the name NoSQL. These databases usually also
    provide very fast access to the stored data. Instead of the database engine having to parse SQL and join together
    the data you specified in your query, NoSQL databases are tuned to instantly fetch the requested data through their
    API.
