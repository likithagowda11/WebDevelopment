  <h3>Cascading style Sheets</h3>
  <br>
  <p id="cc"> Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the
    process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables
    you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it
    prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS
    lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.

    While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over
    the presentation of an HTML document.</p>

        <p id="cc">TCSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
          fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
          specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
          relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and
          enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
          formatting.

          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
          styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
          screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
          content is accessed on a mobile device.

          The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than
          one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

          The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
          text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation
          service for CSS documents.

          In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
          CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>

        <p id="cc">CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim
          Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and
          discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS
          Recommendation being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became
          co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.

          Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language
          (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.One requirement for a web style
          sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet
          languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced
          by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.

          As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web
          developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex
          HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,made consistent site
          appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor
          developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could
          therefore not be linked to documents on the web.Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the
          structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for
          printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.
