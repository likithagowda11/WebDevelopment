    <h4>What Does Web Development Mean?</h4>
  </a>
  <br>
  <p id="cc">Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via
    intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, web content development,
    client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks.In a broader sense, web
    development encompasses all the actions, updates, and operations required to build, maintain and manage a
    website to ensure its performance, user experience, and speed are optimal.

    It might also, but not necessarily, include all those strategic actions needed to ensure its proper ranking on
    search engine results. Usually, those tasks pertain to a different specialization, namely search engine
    optimization (SEO)

    Web development is also known as website development, while the professionals that maintain a website are called
    web developers or (more commonly) web devs.</p>

  <h5>The web development hierarchy is as follows:</h5>
  <br>
  <ul id="cc">
    <li class="lli"><a class="lli" href="client.html">Client-side coding.</a></li>
    <br>
    <li class="lli"><a class="lli" href="server.html">Server-side coding.</a></li>
    <br>
    <li class="lli"><a class="lli" href="database.html">Database-technology.</a></li>
  </ul>
  <div id="cc">
    <br>
    <p>Most web devs use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript to develop
      websites.</p>
    <br>
    <p>HTML defines the basic framework of a website – the foundation upon which everything else is built upon. It
      forms the blocks that define a page’s layout, format, and critical components. Although it is theoretically
      possible to code a website on HTML only, it will be just a barebone site with no functions unless it’s
      enriched with CSS and JavaScript. Also, even simple style modifications such as changing the color of a button
      require a lot of coding to be executed using HTML only.</p>
    <br>
    <p>CSS is used to style the content of a website using a small set of files that are kept across the entire
      site. This way, whenever a change must be applied to say, consistently change the color of all the buttons
      found in every page of the website, a web dev needs to edit only a single file in CSS.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The JavaScript programming language is used to take care of the interactivity of many unique website
      elements. It can be used to create effects that alter the appearance of icons and drop-down menus, add
      animations, games, and other interactive elements.</p>
    <p>Web developers are usually divided into front-end devs, back-end devs, and full-stack devs. A front-end dev
      takes care of all the visual aspects of the website (layout, navigation bar, etc.), its interactivity, and
      binds together all its elements.

    </p>
    <p>Back-end devs take care of less visible tasks that ensure the website runs smoothly, such as managing the
      website’s hosting services, database, and applications. Back-end devs might need to engineer solution to
      server issues by using additional server-side languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, and PHP.</p>

    <a class="lli" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development_tools">
      <h4>Web development tools</h4>
    </a>
    <br>
    <p id="cc">Web development tools (often called devtools or inspect element) allow web developers to test and debug
      their source code. They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that
      they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface
      of a website or web application.

      Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built-in features in modern web browsers.</p>
    <p id="cc">Browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Opera, have
      built-in tools to help web developers, and many additional add-ons can be found in their respective plugin
      download centers.

      Web development tools allow developers to work with a variety of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, the DOM,
      JavaScript, and other components that are handled by the web browser. Due to increasing demand from web browsers
      to do more,[failed verification] popular web browsers have included more features geared for developers.</p>

      <h4>How can I start to learn Web Development?</h4>
    </a>
    <p id="cc">It totally depends on how much you are interested in and are serious about it. if you desperately wanted
      to learn then you can easily be an expert on it. There’s nothing like it’s so hard or something like it’s so
      difficult to design websites like we use or look around our day-to-day life. e.g: Facebook, Google, Amazon,
      Flipkart, Snapdeal, and many more.

      But if we really think about it, Scaring is natural, comes to mind when we look at it as a bunch of graphical
      elements like different colors, different kinds of fonts, images, Card views, Tables, Animations, etc. and the
      most interesting one is the term called ‘Responsive’ websites, responsive websites are those websites which change
      it’s element’s alignments, spacing, etc according to the device it’s browsing. </p>
    <p id="cc">But nowadays it’s not a very hard concept anymore, you can easily design your website responsive with the
      help of some predefined libraries, we have so many types of frameworks available for designing websites and the
      best thing is that it’s all freely available to use, you just need to learn ‘How to use it. Now if you are
      wondering about how to learn it then just don’t worry about it. I am sharing one of the best sources available on
      the Internet to learn all these things freely and easily, you just need to follow it and practice it own. If you
      are reading this Blog then definitely you want to become a website developer, really want to become a developer.
      Waw! it’s really dame true, to learn website designing web is the best place you will ever have.</p>

    <p id="cc">It will be something like you no need to study theory concepts of something first then do the practice of
      that, what actually we all do during our academics. You will learn the concept with the whole details about the
      effect of that learning. You will see all different kinds of things that developed day by day and when you will
      observe it, you want to do it yourself which emphasizes you to learn more day by day. You will be always engaged
      with the field you are working on. Let’s start learning Web… </p>
    <a class="lli" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application#Development">
      <h4>Web application</h4>
    </a>
    <p id="cc">A web application (or web app) is application software that is accessed using a web browser. Web
      applications are delivered on the World Wide Web to users with an active network connection.In earlier computing
      models like client-server, the processing load for the application was shared between code on the server and code
      installed on each client locally. In other words, an application had its own pre-compiled client program which
      served as its user interface and had to be separately installed on each user's personal computer. An upgrade to
      the server-side code of the application would typically also require an upgrade to the client-side code installed
      on each user workstation, adding to the support cost and decreasing productivity. In addition, both the client and
      server components of the application were usually tightly bound to a particular computer architecture and
      operating system and porting them to others was often prohibitively expensive for all but the largest
      applications.</p>
